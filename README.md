# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

Bobby and I are under contract with Pewlett Hackard to redo their messy and outdated employee database. We began by creating multiple tables via pgAdmin and added those tables into a Postgres database called PH-EmployeeDB. Afterwards, Bobby's manager asked us to put together a list of employees who are nearing retirement, per title, and identify which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program that's in the works. The retiring employees in this tentative program will essentially train their own replacements while gradually lessening their workloads until retirement. It's a cool concept, actually. They call this retiring group of employees the "silver tsunami," which is an absolutely awesome name. Who thought of that and when were they fired?
